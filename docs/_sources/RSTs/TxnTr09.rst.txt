#######################
Transaction Tracker v.9
#######################

************
Introduction
************

This Excel-based utility - *formerly the* **Tax Workbook** - is designed to manage creating and maintaining Banking Transactions Data for Tax Purposes and Budget Management in spreadsheet form. The workbook contains transaction data imported from CSV files downloaded from the user's banking institution, which are then categorised to enable revenue and expense tracking.

This Excel-based approach replaces the paper ledger. It was originally designed to identify tax-data figures: the tax accountant requested an income and expenditures summary worksheet in Excel. Using the power of Excel and VBA, data from downloaded CSV files populated the Accounts Worksheets, which informed fields on the Summary Sheet through links: this happened dynamically. In this version, the Summary worksheet has been removed as it is no longer needed, replaced by budgeting worksheets. 

This Transaction Tracker is a living document, both from a data as well as a VBA standpoint. As income-and-expenses pictures change over time, this document - version 0.9 - is a much simplified version to previous versions.

********************************
Transaction Tracker - Worksheets
********************************

===================
Worksheets Overview
===================

When **Transaction Tracker** is first opened in Excel, security settings - commonly set by organisations to prevent malicious code from being executed - may issue a security warning:
   
   * *Some active content has been disabled. Click for more details.*
   
Next to this warning is a button labelled **[Enable Content]**. While the spreadsheet's data can be viewed without "enabling content", the menu and other features in this workbook will only run if the content is enabled.

This only needs to be done the first time that particular workbook is opened.

The workbook is made up of several worksheets, some of which contain links to other worksheets. The main account worksheets (data) represent a checking account, creditcard account, and a personal savings account.

The analysis worksheets are **TSy** and the **Overview** sheets. There are also sheets of analysis by Quarter (Qtr1-4 and Bud-Q1-4).

The data worksheets - **Checking**, **CreditCard** and **Savings** - use a naming convention of the last three digits of the account and the description. The data is categorised through codes, seen in this example:

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/pubimages/appmgr/tw01Codes01.png




================
Process Overview
================

This workbook assumes three accounts: Checking, Savings and CreditCard. The process is as follows:

  1. The data to populate the worksheets is downloaded from the banking institution's website and saved in a CSV file, typically saved to a folder labelled with the download date. The files are named using the last 3 digits of the account name. Depending on how frequently this is done, one may wish to download 60, 90 or even 120 days worth of data to ensure no transactions are missed.

  2. Each CSV file is opened in (imported into) Excel. **In the ribbon, select Data, then Get Data -> From Text/CSV**. After sorting the data from oldest to newest, the transactions that have not yet been copied to the corresponding worksheet are copied over using Copy Special: Values. Once the data has been copied, the CSV sheet can be deleted as well as the connection that was formed by Excel, as it is no longer needed.

  3. So that the original bank-generated transaction information is preserved, the transaction list is cut from column C and pasted into Column G.
  
  4. The transactions are identified - if they exist in the AList worksheet. **Transaction Tracker -> Click on the menu item** respresenting that account, i.e., Checking, CredCard or Savings.
  
  5. Any transactions not in the AList worksheet needs to be categorised by selecting the uncategorised Transaction Target fields and copying that list to the bottom of the AList column A. The approach to take is outlined here: :REF:`tw9-txncategoring`. Once the new entries have been given categories, step 4 above is repeated, until all transactions have been categorised.

========
Checking
========

The **Checking** Worksheet is a date-sorted, formatted Checking Account transaction worksheet. Typically, payroll, home-loan and investment property transactions, as well as certain utilities payments were recorded in this account. After the data is imported from a CSV file downloaded from the bank's website and sorted oldest to newest, the most recent records are appended to the existing data. Prior to processing, the Transaction Target entries are moved to column G.

The columns are as follows::

	A - Date
	B - Transaction Amount
	C - Processed Transaction Target (Payee or Payor)
	D - Transaction Code
	E - (Empty)
	F - (Empty)
	G - Original Transaction Target (**moved** from column C)

After the transactions have been copied, the Code Assignment script is invoked:

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/pubimages/appmgr/tw08Codes06.png

At the end of processing, the user can determine if any entries lack a transaction code at the top-right of the worksheet, in column I. If the number is greater than 0, one or more transaction still needs categorising. During processing, the transaction target - column C - is given a standard description, leaving either a 'FROM' or 'TO' prefix if appropriate, and the appropriate code is entered for the transaction in column D.

===========
Credit Card
===========

The **568CreditCard** Worksheet is a date-sorted, formatted Credit Card transaction worksheet. The data is imported from a CSV file downloaded from the bank's website. The data is sorted oldest to newest and the most recent records are appended to the existing data.

The columns are as follows::

    A - Date
    B - Transaction Amount
    C - Processed Transaction Target (Payee or Payor)
    D - Transaction Code
    E - (Empty)
    F - (Empty)
    G - Original Transaction Target (moved from column C)

After the transactions have been appended and the PAYMENT transaction categorised (see :REF:`tw9-ccpayment`), the Code Assignment script is invoked:

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/pubimages/appmgr/tw08Codes04.png

The script compares transaction target entries to those in the 'AList' worksheet, leaving the Code column [D] blank if it doesn't find that tranaction. With time, ninety percent or more transactions are going to be with the same vendors, so it's a simple matter of updating 'AList' and re-running the script.

For example, this is a typical credit card transaction listing:

*****************************
The Code Running The Workbook
*****************************

===============
Processing Code
===============

For those who might be curious as to how certain features work, I offer the following as a bit of a discussion on my approach to solving these little problems. My code is quite basic and of course open-source: anyone can modify it to suit their needs. To view the code, press [Alt] [F11] and you will be presented with the Visual Basic Editor. These user-defined functions and sub-routines - *including those used on the worksheets* - are stored in the MdlT modules page. 

Some of this code is still under development, and doesn't quite do as I'd like it to.


-----------
Ribbon Code
-----------

The **Transaction Tracker** ribbon buttons code is stored under the **MSO Ribbon Code** and **Callback Buttons Actions** sections. When the button is clicked in the **Transaction Tracker** menu item, it first fires the corresponding code in the **MSO Ribbon Code** section, which calls the **RunScript** sub-routine with the value it receives from the **CheckFilterMode** function as well as the sheet number the button is associated with - 1: Checking / 2: Creditcard / 3: Savings - sent as parameters (arguments).  The **CheckFilterMode** function checks that no filters have been set on that sheet. The code cannot run against a sheet with filters set. If no filters have been set, then the **TxnCodes** function is called, with the sheet number sent as parameter.

Using the menu option "CredCard" in the ribbon under **Transaction Tracker** as an example:

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/pubimages/appmgr/tw08Codes04.png

invokes the _Click() event for that button, which runs the following code:

.. code-block:: vbnet

  'Callback for btnCreditCard onAction
  Sub btnCC_Click(control As IRibbonControl)
    Call RunScript(CheckFilterMode(2), 2)
  End Sub

In the process of calling **RunScript**, **CheckFilterMode** is called first with the sheet number as parameter. That function checks to see if a filter was set on that worksheet, and returns the filter status, which status is sent as first parameter, along with the sheet number. **RunScript** checks the filter status and if it is set the user is notified and processing is aborted. 

Barring a set filter, **RunScript** calls the **TxnCodes** routine with the sheet number as parameter:

.. code-block:: vbnet

  Public Sub RunScript(FilterSet As Boolean, sShtNo As Integer)
    If sShtNo = 100 Then Call ChecksOS:  Exit Sub

    If FilterSet Then
      MsgBox ThisWorkbook.collMsgs("msgFilter")
    Else
      Call TxnCodes(sShtNo)
    End If
  End Sub

Note: *you may see pre-processor directives - stuff preceded by a '#' - that's for debugging and doesn't really affect the code itself*. 

The first line of the **RunScript** sub actually calls **Help** - this document you are reading - via the browser. If the number 100 is sent instead of 1, 2 or 3, the **CheckOS** function is called: 

.. code-block:: vbnet

  Public Function ChecksOS()

    '  first 3 chars will be either Win or Mac
    Dim sOS As String
    sOS = Mid(Application.OperatingSystem, 1, 3)

    Dim sLink As String
    sLink = ThisWorkbook.collMsgs("linkHelp")

    If sOS = "Win" Then
      Call bOpenInEdge(sLink)
    End If
    If sOS = "Mac" Then
      MsgBox ThisWorkbook.collMsgs("msgHelpLink")
    End If
  End Function

Office behaves differently in Windows than on the Mac, so I had to provide some - rather awkward - solution for Mac users:

.. code-block:: vbnet

  Public Function bOpenInEdge(sURL As String) As Boolean
  Dim sFullURL As String
    sFullURL = ThisWorkbook.collMsgs("linkURL") & sURL
    CreateObject("Shell.Application").ShellExecute sFullURL
  End Function

In Windows, clicking on **Help** will bring up the Edge browser and these pages. On the Mac, I provide the link to this help file in a messagebox. {{{sigh}}} Sometimes the magic works.


----------------------
Process that Worksheet
----------------------

In the **PROCESS WORKSHEETS** section is the main code that assigns category codes to transactions. Generally, the contents of the AList worksheet are dumped into an array, and then column G of the target worksheet gets stepped through row by row. If a code already exists for that transaction in column D, that row is ignored. If the code is missing, then the entry in column G is run through the array until it finds a match, using the magic of regular expressions. Columns C and D are then given the values of that array item, and the process is repeated for the next row.

Note: the author realises that this is certainly not the fastest or most efficient mechanism ever designed, but it works, and it's reasonably fast. The use of an array and regular expressions ensures some improvements on processing speed.*





==============
Worksheet UDFs
==============

A UDF is a 'user-defined function': it can be used in place of Excel's own functions. Transaction tallies for a given category - based on Transaction Category Codes - are usually done using Excel's own SUMIF() function... for example::

	=ABS(SUMIF('568CreditCard'!$D165:$D399,"HSHPHO",'568CreditCard'!$B165:$B399))

Note: *the use of SUMIF() has been largely replaced with a User-Defined Function (UDF) called calcABS(), particularly on the Budget worksheets. See* :ref:`tw9-calcABS` *for how this works*.

Using the CreditCard worksheet as an example, the codes in column D are assigned via Excel's Visual-Basic for Applications functions (VBA), copied from the **AList Worksheet** which has an instance of the Transaction Target and an associated code:

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/pubimages/appmgr/tw01Codes03.png

The script that copies the Transaction Code from the AList sheet to the **CreditCard** sheet is run from **Transaction Tracker** menu option under the main menu, i.e., the 'Ribbon':

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/pubimages/appmgr/tw08Codes04.png

Much of the workbook's data is managed in this fashion.


.. _tw9-calcABS:

-------
calcABS
-------

This function is used on the **TypeSummary** worksheet as well as the Quarterly budget sheets (Qtr1, Qtr2, etc).

.. code-block:: vbnet

	Public Function calcABS(sSht As String, tCode As String, _
	                        nRangeS As Integer, nRangeE As Integer) As Double
	Dim sRangeD As String, sRangeB As String

		sRangeD = "D" & stp(nRangeS) & ":D" & stp(nRangeE)
		sRangeB = "B" & stp(nRangeS) & ":B" & stp(nRangeE)

		Select Case sSht
			Case Is = "ch"
				calcABS = Abs(WorksheetFunction.SumIf(sh259.Range(sRangeD), tCode, sh259.Range(sRangeB)))
			Case Is = "cc"
				calcABS = Abs(WorksheetFunction.SumIf(sh568.Range(sRangeD), tCode, sh568.Range(sRangeB)))
			Case Is = "sv"
				calcABS = Abs(WorksheetFunction.SumIf(sh972.Range(sRangeD), tCode, sh972.Range(sRangeB)))
		End Select
	End Function

This is typically called thus (e.g., for 'Phone/Internet')::

	=calcABS("ch","HSHPHO",E13,E14) + calcABS("cc","HSHPHO",E15,E16) + calcABS("sv","HSHPHO",E17,E18)

calcABS() replaced the following formulae::

	=ABS(SUMIF('568CreditCard'!$D165:$D399,"HSHPHO",'568CreditCard'!$B165:$B399) + SUMIF('259Checking'!$D$65:$D159,"HSHPHO",'259Checking'!$B$65:$B159))

This approach expects the following table on the Qtr1 (and subsequent quarters) worksheet in a specific range - D13:E18 - and formatted in this manner:

+--------------------------+
|      Field Ranges        |
+===================+======+
| Checking Start    |   2  |
+-------------------+------+
| Checking End      |  64  |
+-------------------+------+
| CreditCard Start  |   2  |
+-------------------+------+
| CCreditCard End   | 164  |
+-------------------+------+
| Savings Start     |   2  |
+-------------------+------+
| Savings End       |  66  |
+-------------------+------+

The 'Start' and 'End' numbers are references to the beginning and end of that quarter's date range on that particular worksheet, e.g., 01/07/2024 - 30/09/2024 (*using the normal DD/MM/YYYY format used everywhere BBUT in the US*)

Maintenance is easy, if a bit kludgy: the following quarter, a copy is made of the current worksheet, the copy is renamed using 'Qtr' and {number of quarter}, i.e., **Qtr2**, and the table is updated thus:

+--------------------------+
|      Field Ranges        |
+===================+======+
| Checking Start    |  65  |
+-------------------+------+
| Checking End      | 509  |
+-------------------+------+
| CreditCard Start  | 165  |
+-------------------+------+
| CCreditCard End   | 519  |
+-------------------+------+
| Savings Start     |  67  |
+-------------------+------+
| Savings End       | 529  |
+-------------------+------+

The start numbers are, of course, last quarter's end number incremented by 1, and the end numbers for the last quarter's date range - (e.g., 509, 519, 529) - are just arbitrarily assigned. At the end of the last month of the quarter, when the actual worksheet's last cell row number is known, that number is entered. Then, a copy is made of that worksheet and the process is repeated. 

The advantage to this approach is that formula errors are avoided, or far more easily identifed and fixed. It also removes the tedium of having to go into each formula::

	=ABS(SUMIF('568CreditCard'!$D165:$D399,"HSHPHO",'568CreditCard'!$B165:$B399)

and changing range values manually; again, another frequent source of error.

The last word for this process remains to be said.


----------------------------
sParseAllWords({cellnumber})
----------------------------

Note, *as of 2024-10-17, this function has been rendered obsolete, and will be removed from the code*.

.. code-block:: vbnet

	Public Function ParseAllWords(StringToParse As String) As String
		If Len(StringToParse & vbNullString) = 0 Then Exit Function

		If Trim(InStr(1, StringToParse, " ")) = 0 Then
			ParseAllWords = Trim(StringToParse)
		Else
			ParseAllWords = WorksheetFunction.Trim(StringToParse)
		End If
	End Function


.. _tw9-ccpayment:

-------------------
Creditcard Payments
-------------------

For the credit card, the app looks at the entry for "PAYMENT" - the only fairly ambiguous entries in this worksheet - and then checks the two-character code after the word "THANKYOU"... this code is entered prior to processing:

+-------------------------------------+
| Codes and Suffixes                  |
+======+==============================+
|  cc  |  Creditcard repayment        |
+------+------------------------------+
|  ri  |  Reimbursement for purchase  |
+------+------------------------------+

Additional Notes

.. _tw9-txncategoring:

====================================
Creating Categories for Transactions
====================================

To categorise transactions, one needs to develop a naming scheme that can work consistently throughout the worksheets. Creating too many categories will lead to tedium, so avoid being too granular. For example:

+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| 3-char base code prefix & 3-char refinement suffix                |
+======+========+=========+=========================================+
| DLX  |  -ALC  |  DLXALC | Daily Living expenses & Alcohol         |
+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| DLX  |  -ALI  |  DLXALI | Daily Living expenses & Alimentation    |
+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| DLX  |  -DIN  |  DLXDIN | Daily Living expenses & Dining Out      |
+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| DLX  |  -ENT  |  DLXENT | Daily Living expenses & Entertainment   |
+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| DLX  |  -HAI  |  DLXHAI | Daily Living expenses & Hair/Nails      |
+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| HSH  |  -FUR  |  HSHFUR | Household & Furnishings                 |
+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| HSH  |  -ITX  |  HSHITX | Household & IT Expenses                 |
+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+
| HSH  |  -MAI  |  HSHMAI | Household & Maintenance                 |
+------+--------+---------+-----------------------------------------+

The user may wish to be more granular than the example shown above, but will find that doing so can render the categorising process more difficult in the end, as would not being granular enough. Planning this process carefully will ultimately make maintaining the workbook significantly less tedious. The above approach could be used for expenses, whilst revenue could use an "REV" prefix:

+------+----------+-----------+-------------------------------------+
| 3-char base code prefix & 5-char refinement suffix                |
+======+==========+===========+=====================================+
| REV  |  -REFND  |  REVREFND | Revenue: Refunds                    |
+------+----------+-----------+-------------------------------------+
| REV  |  -AUPEN  |  REVAUPEN | Revenue: Australian Pension         |
+------+----------+-----------+-------------------------------------+

Having only revenue with "REV" as prefix and 5-digit suffixes make that transaction quick and easy to identify in a worksheet.These are, of course, all only suggestions. No doubt the user will come up with an infinitely cleverer scheme.




.. _tw9-SavingsCodes:

========================
Quick Note on Savings
========================

*New for version 0.8*

Many transactions happen through Paypal. These are extremely difficult to keep tabs on, as the entry in the worksheet is a mere::

	PAYMENT TO PAYPAL AUSTRALIA 1021851015462

To identify the transaction prior to running the script to assign categories involves opening GMail, PayPal and Ebay -> Purchase History. Once it has been established who the payment went to and what for, I prefix the entry with a cryptic identifier (e.g., SSD) followed by a '-', then include a categorised entry in the AList worksheet.


=====================
Additional Discussion
=====================

With v.8, I had endeavoured to create a somewhat cross-platform utility. I do most of what I do on a computer on a Macbook Pro (2015), running Windows 10 in a VM. Development of anything VBA occurs in this VM environment. However, I do need to get to the data at times on the Mac, so I load these workbooks in Excel 2016 for Mac. Help is a challenge: I can't invoke a browser within Excel Mac like I can in Windows (to my knowledge, anyway). So, I just display the link in a MsgBox and have the Mac user copy/paste that into the browser.

Yeah, a kludge, but it works.
